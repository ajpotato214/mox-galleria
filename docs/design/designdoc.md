# Background
The MTG alter and signed card community is a relatively small and niche community with an online presence in various subreddits, Discord channels, and Facebook groups. It is often cumbersome to post pictures of my collection in these online groups because posts are generally unorganized and can get burried over time due to the linear nature. I also feel alters and signed cards should have consistent, high quality scans rather than photos taken from mobile phones of varying quality. 

The goal is to create a website that showcases my personal collection in _one_ place with high quality scans and other useful card metadata.
